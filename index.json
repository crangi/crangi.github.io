It’s one of the key assumptions of financial math, making a lot of complex theories work neatly. But the real world market data feels a lot messier than a perfect bell curve, doesn’t it?\nSo, in this blog, I decided to put this textbook theory to the test. Let’s grab some real stock data and see if it actually behaves the way the models say it should. We’ll be detectives, using a few simple graphical and statistical tools to uncover the truth.\nGraphical tests Visual checks are a great first step to get a feel for the data. Today, we will be looking at two such tests.\nQuantile-Quantile(Q-Q) plot: With a Q-Q plot, the observed data’s quantiles are plotted against the theoretical quantiles (normal distribution in our case). This one sounds complicated, but it’s basically a “line-up” test. We ask our data’s values to line up against where they should be in a perfect normal distribution (theoretical quantiles). If our data is truly “normal,” the points on the plot will form a perfectly straight diagonal line. If they start wandering off—especially at the ends—it’s a dead giveaway that something else is going on.\nBox plot: The box plot is a quick check for our data’s symmetry. Imagine a perfectly balanced scale: the median line is the center point, and the box and whiskers are evenly spread on both sides. If one side is much longer than the other or the median is off-center, it’s a clear signal that our data is skewed and not following a normal distribution.\nThe main drawback of these tests, however, is that they’re subjective—we’re sometimes just eyeballing it. They don’t give us a hard number to measure exactly how much our data deviates from normality. That’s where statistical tests come in - they give us a clear, quantifiable result.\nStatistical tests Statistical tests give us a clear mathematical verdict. They work by first assuming the data is normal and then calculating how likely it is we would see our particular dataset under that assumption.\nThis likelihood is called the p-value. In simple terms: if the p-value is low (less than 0.05), it means our data is a very bad fit for the normal distribution model. So, a low p-value gives us statistical proof that our data is not normal.\nThe specific test we’ll be using in this blog is the Shapiro-Wilk test. Another popular statistical test is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test which we’ll not be using today.\nTesting the evidence of normal distribution for JPMorgan Chase \u0026amp; Co For this test, I’m choosing JPMorgan Chase \u0026amp; Co (JPM), but you can follow along with any stock you’re curious about! Just change the ticker from ‘JPM’ to something else (like ‘AAPL’ or ‘TSLA’) in the code below and see what you find.\nLet us import the necessary python modules import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import scipy.stats as stats import seaborn as sns import yfinance as yf import datetime as dt # Setting global matplotlib parameters import matplotlib as mpl import matplotlib.dates as mdates mpl.rcParams[\u0026#34;xtick.labelsize\u0026#34;] = 22 mpl.rcParams[\u0026#34;ytick.labelsize\u0026#34;] = 22 mpl.rcParams[\u0026#39;axes.titlesize\u0026#39;] = 22 mpl.rcParams[\u0026#39;figure.dpi\u0026#39;] = 300 mpl.rcParams[\u0026#39;axes.labelsize\u0026#39;] = 24 mpl.rcParams[\u0026#39;font.family\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;serif\u0026#39; mpl.rcParams[\u0026#34;mathtext.fontset\u0026#34;] = \u0026#39;cm\u0026#39; Downloading 10 year of JPM data EndDate = dt.datetime.today() StartDate = EndDate - pd.DateOffset(years=10) JPMStockData = yf.download(\u0026#39;JPM\u0026#39;, start = StartDate, end = EndDate)[\u0026#34;Close\u0026#34;] JPMStockReturns = JPMStockData/JPMStockData.shift(1) JPMStockLogReturns = np.log(JPMStockReturns.dropna())[\u0026#39;JPM\u0026#39;].values Dates = JPMStockReturns.dropna().index Let us plot the Q-Q and box plot of log returns of JPM stock using built-in plotting functions from statsmodel and matplotlib fig, axes = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(16, 6),dpi=300) stats.probplot(JPMStockLogReturns, dist=\u0026#34;norm\u0026#34;, plot=axes[0]) axes[0].set_title(\u0026#34;JPMorgan Chase \u0026amp; Co Log Returns Q-Q Plot\u0026#34;) axes[0].grid(True) axes[1].boxplot(JPMStockLogReturns) axes[1].set_xlabel(\u0026#34;Variable\u0026#34;) axes[1].set_ylabel(\u0026#34;Value\u0026#34;) axes[1].set_title(\u0026#34;JPMorgan Chase \u0026amp; Co Log Returns Box Plot\u0026#34;) plt.tight_layout() plt.show() The Q-Q plot above shows the dots veering off the straight line, creating what analysts call “heavy tails.” Think of these as the market’s mood swings—the unexpectedly huge up and down days that the neat bell curve just can’t predict.

This blog will give a very brief introduction and background of the Majorana zero modes and way to obtain them in a simple model known as the Kitaev Chain. The aim will be to translate the Kitaev Chain Hamiltonian into a Matrix form to obtain energy spectrum and edge modes for an open chain. We will obtain these Majorana zero modes at the edges of an open chain.\nMajorana Fermions In the year 1937, a new class of particles that are its own anti-particles were hypothesized by Ettore Majorana. This new class were termed Majorana fermions or particles for obvious reasons. They can be mathematically represented by creation and anhilation operators in second quantization:\n$$\\gamma^\\dagger_k = \\gamma_k$$ where, $\\gamma_k$: anhilates a particle in quantum state k; $\\gamma_k^\\dagger$: creates a particle in quantum state k\nThe equation above conveys that the operators for creating and destroying the particles are same, which is the desired property of the Majorana in contrast to Dirac fermions for which they are distinct. The above operators shall be referred as Majorana operators. There are several conventions to define these Majorana operators. We will be adopting the following($f$ is the fermionic operator):\n\\begin{align} f^\\dagger = (\\gamma_1 + i\\gamma_2)/2 \\nonumber \\qquad f = (\\gamma_1 - i\\gamma_2)/2 \\label{2} \\end{align}\nUsing this definition, the following identities can be checked\n$\\gamma_k^2 = 1$ $\\left[\\gamma_i,\\gamma_j\\right] = 2\\delta_{ij}$ There have been lot of attempts in experimental high energy physics to hunt these particles.\nMajorana Zero Modes Let’s shift gears and enter the realm of condensed matter physics. In superconducting materials, certain quasiparticle(Bogoliubov) excitations display similar properties as that of Majorana fermions. The Majorana zero mode(MZM) is a special case of Bogoliubov quasiparticle operators which are linear combinations of electron and hole operator. The MZM satisfy the properties that they square to identity and are self-Hermitian.\nIf we look carefully at above equations, the two Majorana modes always occurs in pair for a single fermionic mode. Can we decouple them? This was cleverly answered by Professor Alexei Kitaev in 2001, through his Kitaev chain, which is a 1D p-wave superconducting model.\nKitaev Chain Kitaev Chain is a tight binding lattice model of spinless electrons with nearest-neighbour hopping amplitude $t$, a p-wave superconducting pairing term $\\Delta$ for nearest neighbours and on-site chemical potential $\\mu$. The hamiltonian for a finite and open chain in second quantization can be jotted down \\begin{equation} \\hat{H} = \\sum_{n=1}^{N-1}\\left[t\\left(f_n^\\dagger f_{n+1} + f_{n+1}^\\dagger f_n\\right) + \\Delta\\left(f_n f_{n+1} + f_{n+1}^\\dagger f_n^\\dagger\\right)\\right] - \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\mu \\left( 2f_n^\\dagger f_n - 1 \\right) \\label{real_space_Hamiltonian} \\end{equation} where $t,\\Delta$ and $\\mu$ are all real and $\\gamma \u0026gt; 0$ without loss of generality. Similar to the definition above, we define the following Majorana operators \\begin{align} a_{2n-1} = f_n + f_n^\\dagger \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a_{2n} = i(f_n - f_n^\\dagger) \\label{4} \\end{align} for n = 1,2,…,N. The Kitaev Chain Hamiltonian can be rewritten in terms of these Majorana operators \\begin{equation} \\hat{H} = i\\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \\left[J_xa_{2n}a_{2n+1} - J_ya_{2n-1} a_{2n+2}\\right] + i\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\mu a_{2n-1}a_{2n} \\end{equation} where, $J_x = \\frac{1}{2}(t - \\Delta) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad J_y = \\frac{1}{2}(t + \\Delta)$\nLet us carefully examine the Hamiltonian in the Majorana basis. A brief look will help us solve the problem of decoupling. Let us look at two special cases in the parameter space of $t, \\Delta$ and $\\mu$.\nCase I: $t = \\Delta$ and $\\mu = 0$\nThe conditions clearly imply $J_x=0$ and $J_y=t$ which results in \\begin{equation} \\hat{H} = -i\\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \\left[t a_{2n-1} a_{2n+2}\\right] \\label{6} \\end{equation}\nDid we end up finding something interesting? A close attention to the equation above reveals that the even(odd) Majorana mode at the left(right) end has vanished and it is decoupled from the rest of the modes. This is exactly what we set out for! The unpaired Majorana modes.\nCase II: $t = -\\Delta$ and $\\mu = 0$\nThis time $J_y = 0$ and $J_x = t$ which results in \\begin{equation} \\hat{H} = i\\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \\left[t a_{2n}a_{2n+1}\\right] \\end{equation}\nThis time, the odd(even) Majorana mode at the left(right) end of the chain is unpaired with the rest of the chain.\nWonderful! We know a way to obtain the unpaired Majorana end modes.

I am following ‘The Oxford Solid state Basics’ book by Prof. Steven H. Simon. If the material covered is unclear, please refer the book suggested above. In any case, go through that book. It is a lovely book to read!\nHistorical note: It was well known that the heat capacity per atom for a solid is given by $C \\approx 3k_B$ or in other terms, molar heat capacity is $C \\approx 3R$, where $R$ is the Universal gas constant. This empirical observation was known as Dulong-Petit Law.\nLet us look at heat capacities for different chemicals at room temperature($T = 25^oC$)1:\nThe above figure shows the heat capacities for various chemical elements at a temperature of 25 $^0C$ and a pressure of 100kPa. It is evident that most of them follow Dulong-Petit Law.\nHow do we explain this empirical observation? The answer was provided by Boltzmann using classical statistical mechanics. We will take his approach and understand the source of this empirical law.\nBoltzmann approach: Classical Statistical Mechanics The key idea in his approach was to assume atoms inside a solid to be in a harmonic potential under the influence of neighbouring atoms: Imagine the same model with chain of such atoms forming a solid in 3 spatial dimensions(3D) at a fixed temperature T. Now, the Hamiltonian for each atom can be written as: $$ \\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p}) = \\frac{\\mathbf{p}^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2\\mathbf{q}^2$$\nNote:\nWe assumed the spring constant to be same in all three dimensions. Quantities $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\mathbf{q}$ are three dimensional vectors. Since we have a large collection of such atoms at a fixed temperature T, we can find its energy and heat constant using classical canonical partition function. The single-particle partition function is given by, $$ Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3}\\int\\int e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p})}d\\mathbf{q}d\\mathbf{p}$$\nWe shall explicitly evaluate this quantity. It will be handy to recall the Gaussian integral of one variable: $$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ax^2}dx = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}}$$\nLet us get our hands dirty!\n$$Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3}\\int\\int e^{-\\beta(\\frac{\\mathbf{p}^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2\\mathbf{q}^2)}d\\mathbf{q}d\\mathbf{p} \\ = \\frac{1}{h^3} \\int exp{\\frac{-\\beta\\mathbf{p}^2}{2m}} d\\mathbf{p} \\int exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2}{2}\\mathbf{q}^2} d\\mathbf{q} $$\nWe can further separate the 3D integral into a product of three 1D integrals in both momentum and position coordinates.\n$$ \\begin{align} Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta{p_x}^2}{2m}} dp_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta{p_y}^2}{2m}} dp_y \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta{p_z}^2}{2m}} dp_z \\\\\\ \\text{x} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2q_x^2}{2}} dq_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2q_y^2}{2}} dq_y \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2q_z^2}{2}} dq_z \\end{align} $$\n$$= \\frac{1}{h^3} \\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta{p_x}^2}{2m}} dp_x\\right]^3 \\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2q_x^2}{2}} dq_x\\right]^3$$ Using the 1D Gaussian integrals above, we get\n$$ Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3} \\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi m}{\\beta}}\\right]^3 \\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta m \\omega^2}} \\right]^3 = \\left[\\frac{k_B T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right]^3$$ where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\\hbar = h/2\\pi$. The N particle partition function can be obtained by assuming that the particles are distinguishable: $$Z_N = [Z_1]^N = \\left[\\frac{k_B T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right]^{3N}$$\nWe know, from the connection to thermodynamic quantities, the internal energy of this system can be obtained by $$ E = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\beta}lnZ_N = 3Nk_BT$$\nThus, the heat capacity per atom is $$C_v = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\frac{E}{N} = 3k_B$$\nHooray! We have obtained our result of $3k_B$ for the specific heat. Boltzmann’s idea worked and we can now explain this empirical observation. Thus, Boltzmann accounted lattice vibrations as the source for the heat capacity and modelled it classically as masses connected by a spring.\nIs it the end of the story? Even the graph above will tell you that there are outliers to this empirical law. Particularly, heat capacity of diamond deviates from Dulong-Petit law at room temperatures. Also, heat capacity strongly depends on temperature, and becomes smaller at lower temperatures(Apparently room temperature is a “low” temperature for diamond). What are we missing here? Einstein came up with a brilliant idea to consider quantum mechanics as the key here.\nEinstein’s approach: Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Einstein followed a similar approach to that of Boltzmann except, he used quantized harmonic oscillator levels for each atom, given by $$\\epsilon_n = \\hbar \\omega(n+3/2)$$\nwhere $n = n_x+n_y+n_z$.
